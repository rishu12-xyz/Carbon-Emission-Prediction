# 🌍 Carbon Emission Prediction

This project aims to predict CO₂ emissions from vehicles based on various engine and fuel parameters using machine learning models. The model helps in understanding environmental impact and promoting eco-friendly vehicle choices.

## 📌 Problem Statement

Accurate prediction of carbon emissions is crucial in the fight against climate change. By using real-world vehicle datasets, we aim to create a model that can predict emissions based on input parameters like engine size, fuel type, and vehicle class.

## 🎯 Goals & Objectives

- Analyze and visualize vehicle emission data.
- Clean and preprocess the dataset for optimal performance.
- Train ML models to predict CO₂ emissions.
- Compare results using performance metrics.
- Conclude the most efficient algorithm for this task.

## 🛠️ Tools and Technologies Used

- Python  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn  
- Git & GitHub

## Required Libraries
```pip install numpy pandas seaborn streamlit matplotlib scikit-learn```

## 📁 Dataset

Dataset used: [CO2 Emissions dataset](https://github.com/rishu12-xyz/Carbon-Emission-Prediction/blob/main/Data_cleaned.csv)

The dataset includes features like:
- Engine Size
- Cylinders
- Fuel Type
- Transmission
- Fuel Consumption
- CO₂ Emissions

## 🔍 Methodology

1. **Data Cleaning** – Handling null values, renaming columns  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Visualizing feature relationships  
3. **Feature Encoding** – Converting categorical to numeric  
4. **Train-Test Split** – 80/20 ratio  
5. **Model Training** – Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest  
6. **Evaluation** – RMSE, R² score, and cross-validation

## 📈 Results

The Random Forest model gave the best performance with:
- R² Score: 0.92  
- RMSE: ~12 g/km
